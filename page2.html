        <h1>My Future Goals</h1>
        <p>With a strong foundation in both technology and business, my aspiration to become a consultant is deeply rooted in a comprehensive skill set and diverse professional experiences that uniquely position me for success in this dynamic field.</p>
        <br> 
        <p> My journey, highlighted by significant roles at Oracle as an ERP Functional Support Analyst Intern and at Tarion as a Quality Assurance Analyst, underscores a commitment to leveraging technology to solve complex business challenges.</p>
        <br>    
        <p> At Oracle, I mastered NetSuite products to a 96% proficiency level, demonstrating not just an ability to learn rapidly but also to apply this knowledge in enhancing the Order to Cash process for customers, resulting in a notable decrease in inquiries by 27% and improving transaction processing efficiency by 40%. This achievement, coupled with my efforts that led to a 25% boost in client satisfaction through data analytics and UI/UX improvements, exemplifies my capacity to drive meaningful change through technological innovation. My tenure at Tarion further solidified my skills in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), where I developed documents and flowcharts that streamlined systems and services, improving overall system comprehension. My role at Access Storage as a Marketing Campaign Supervisor, managing a diverse team and coordinating with numerous vendors, honed my leadership, project management, and strategic planning abilities. These experiences are underpinned by a solid academic foundation and certifications in Google Data Analytics, Python Fundamentals, and McGill Financial Management, alongside proficiency in software such as MS Office, JIRA, SalesForce, and technical skills in languages like Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, R, and JavaScript. My volunteer role as the Director of Education at the Toronto Metropolitan Consulting Association has allowed me to impact future consultants by implementing the Case Buddy Program and conducting workshops that develop essential consulting skills. These efforts, aimed at problem-solving, data analysis, and client communication, not only serve to prepare students for the consulting field but also reflect my dedication to community and professional development. This blend of technical proficiency, practical experience, and a commitment to continuous learning and development forms the cornerstone of my aspiration to become a consultant. I am driven by the potential to help businesses navigate and thrive in the digital age, leveraging my background in tech and business to offer innovative solutions that address the complexities of today's market challenges.</p>
